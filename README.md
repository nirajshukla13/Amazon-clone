# 🛒 Amazon Clone (Static UI)

A basic clone of the Amazon India homepage built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project is a static frontend-only replica focusing on the **visual layout and design** of the site — it is **not responsive** and does **not include backend functionality**.
